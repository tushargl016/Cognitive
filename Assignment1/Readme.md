This repository contains the Solution files for the assignment 1

The detailed documentation can be found in the doc file called Analysis Report.docx

Solution for part1 can be found in the file called Assignment1-P1.ipynb, solution for the part2 can be found in the file Assignment1-P2.ipynb.

For part1 we developed MLP models with different layer and did hyperparameter tuning using grid search. It has the one layer two layer and three layer model with their accuracies and layer configurations. 

Final result was that the best layer was a two layer structure with 30 epochs 512 neurons and a batch size of 128 with no dropout layer.

For part2 we performed different pooling layers and showcased the results of using maxpooling vs average pooling.
